So Basically you run the Decision.js file in terminal and give it inputs to take directly which then sends those to Engine.js that evaluates policies which are put in code (not hard coded) - in the future they can be scanned through OCR or some other model which can update the code in policies making the engine reusable for the same updated code.
The Engine then evaluates the policies and gives out the decision alongside why it particularly chose that decision, and the number of policies that evaluated to get to that decision, and the whole reasoning behind why the particular decision was chosen.
 The policies will ultimately be numbered on a priority basis. If three to four policies were to collide with each other for a particular input, then the policy with the highest authority would be executed so that there is no crash in terms of which policies to be chosen.
